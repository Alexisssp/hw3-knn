## Free response questions (5 points)

#### 1. (0.5 points) Assume you've learned a good decision boundary model $\mathbf{w^Tx}$ for a two-way classification with a perceptron. What is the time complexity to select a class label for a new point using this decision boundary. Give your answer as a function of the number of points, $n$, in the data set the decision boundary was learned from? What is the space complexity of the model, in terms of $n$ and the number of dimensions $d$ in the vector representing each data point?

#### 2. (0.5 points) Assume you have a K-nearest neighbor classifier for doing a 2-way classification.  What is the time complexity, as a function of the number of points, $n$, in the data set the decision boundary was learned from? What is the space complexity of the model, in terms of $n$ and the number of dimensions $d$ in the vector representing each data point?
