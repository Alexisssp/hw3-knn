#### 1. (0.5 points) Assume you've learned a good decision boundary model <img src="/tex/9fa880c0493a6190c9cd7031ba53083a.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=35.03868554999999pt height=27.72066330000001pt/> for a two-way classification with a perceptron. What is the time complexity to select a class label for a new point using this decision boundary. Give your answer as a function of the number of points, <img src="/tex/55a049b8f161ae7cfeb0197d75aff967.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=9.86687624999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/>, in the data set the decision boundary was learned from? What is the space complexity of the model, in terms of <img src="/tex/55a049b8f161ae7cfeb0197d75aff967.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=9.86687624999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> and the number of dimensions <img src="/tex/2103f85b8b1477f430fc407cad462224.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=8.55596444999999pt height=22.831056599999986pt/> in the vector representing each data point?

#### 2. (0.5 points) Assume you have a K-nearest neighbor classifier for doing a 2-way classification.  What is the time complexity, as a function of the number of points, <img src="/tex/55a049b8f161ae7cfeb0197d75aff967.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=9.86687624999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/>, in the data set the decision boundary was learned from? What is the space complexity of the model, in terms of <img src="/tex/55a049b8f161ae7cfeb0197d75aff967.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=9.86687624999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> and the number of dimensions <img src="/tex/2103f85b8b1477f430fc407cad462224.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=8.55596444999999pt height=22.831056599999986pt/> in the vector representing each data point?
